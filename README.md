# Advent of Code 2024 - Dart Edition 🎄🎉

Welcome to my *Advent of Code 2024* solutions, crafted with love (and a little bit of Dart magic)! ✨ This repository contains my solutions to the annual Advent of Code challenges, where each day brings a new puzzle to solve — and I’m solving them with Dart, because who doesn’t love a good challenge with a fun language?

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Get Dart on Your Machine
Make sure you have the mighty [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and check if Dart is ready to play:
```bash
dart --version
```

### Step 2: Clone This Fun Ride
Next, clone this repository and let the Advent of Code festivities begin:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/louisphilip/advent-of-code.git
cd advent-of-code
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (if any)
If I’ve used any extra Dart packages to make things sparkle, you can get them with:
```bash
dart pub get
```

## 🎮 How to Play

Each day’s challenge lives in its own little folder (how cute, right?). To solve a challenge, simply navigate to the folder of the day and run the solution.

For example, if you're feeling lucky and want to solve any day’s puzzle, you’ll run:
```bash
dart run
```

Feel free to open all the days like a calendar and solve away! 🔑

## 🧠 My Solutions

Each day’s brain-buster is housed in its very own file under the `lib` folder (`dayXX` where `XX` is the day). Inside, you’ll find:
- **`dayXX.dart`**: The Dart code that cracked the puzzle.
- In a separate `inputs` folder, you’ll find **`<INPUT_FILE(s)>.txt`**: The raw input data that was the key to solving the puzzle. 🔑

## 🗺️ Folder Map

Here’s a peek inside the magical land of folders:

```
advent-of-code/
├── lib/
│   ├── day01.dart
│   ├── day02.dart
│   └── day03.dart
... etc.
├── inputs/
│   ├── day01/
│   │   └── <INPUT_FILE(s)>.txt
│   ├── day02/
│   │   └── <INPUT_FILE(s)>.txt
│   └── day03/
│       └── <INPUT_FILE(s)>.txt
... etc.
└── README.md
```

## 💡 Contributing

I’m all about collaboration! If you think you’ve got a cooler way to solve a puzzle, or have some tips to make the code shine even brighter, feel free to open an issue or send in a pull request. 🤝
